    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Branch</strong>: A parallel version of a repository; basically another workspace. Branches can be contained inside a repository and edited in isolation to not disrupt the live version of the repository.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Clone</strong>: A copy of a repository, usually on a local device (such as your computer) rather than on a server. Though it's a copy, it's still connected to the remote version and can sync with changes made by the clone. </p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Commit</strong>: A change to a file, usually a confirmation for the made changes. These changes are recorded on GitHub. Also is called a 'revision.'</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Fetch</strong>: A way of adding changes to the remote version of a repository from a local branch without committing them. </p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Git</strong>: An open source program for tracking changes made in text files. A core part of GitHub as GitHub is built on top of it.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>GitHub</strong>: A platform that allows users to store, share and read files, particularly in repositories. GitHub can also be used as a host for websites.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Merge</strong>: Action of taking the changes from one branch and applying them to another. Only can be done if both branches are in the same repository or in a fork.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Merge Conflict</strong>: An issue that stops branches from merging. This is caused by differences in the two merging branches, such as applying the changes to a deleted file./p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Push</strong>: Action of sending commited changes to the remote repository. Changes can be made local and pushed.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Pull</strong>: Action of fetching and merging changes to files.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Remote</strong>: Denotes a version of a repository or a branch hosted on a server.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Repository</strong>: The basic element of GitHub. It's a place on the internet that allows you to store files, like a folder, and has features to keep track of documentation such as file history and file changes. They can be made private or public and files can be made and edited inside of them.</p></li>
